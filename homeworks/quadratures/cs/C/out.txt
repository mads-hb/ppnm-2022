Let's solve some test integrals and check how many recursive calls are needed.
Using normal integration: Integral<[1, Infinity] (1/x^2)>.
The total amount of recursive calls was 1.
The integral Integral<[1, Infinity] (1/x^2)> equals 1.

Using normal integration: Integral<[-Infinity, Infinity] (x*Exp(-x*x))>.
The total amount of recursive calls was 1.
The integral Integral<[-Infinity, Infinity] (x*Exp(-x*x))> equals 0.

Now using scipy to integrate the same functions.
The integral of 1/x^2 is 1.0 and took 15 evaluations.
The integral of x*exp(-x^2) is 0.0 and took 30 evaluations.
