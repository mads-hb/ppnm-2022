Clearly, the time it takes to compute the harmonic sum is shorter when we use more than 1 thread. 
However, we cannot use infinitely many threads to go faster. 
The results show that after 11 threads we do not gain any performance improvement. 
At this point the time it takes to spin up a thread is longer than the time 
it takes to just compute the harmonic sum on the interval
