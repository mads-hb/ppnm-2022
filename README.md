# Practical Programming and Numerical Methods 2022
This repository contains all souce code for the 2022 version of the 
[practical programming and numerical methods](http://80.251.205.75/~fedorov/prog/) 
course.

The directories `exercises` and `homeworks` contain solutions to all the exercises and homeworks given throughout the course.
All solutions to exercises and homeworks reside in subdirectories in these directories. Solutions to exercises and homeworks may be provided
in several programming languages and the subdirectories `cs/`, `c/`,  and `cpp` correspond to solutions in C#, C, and C++ respectively.

The directory `exam` is currently empty but will contain all source code needed for the exam project when closing in on the exam due date.

In addition to the directories required to follow the course, a directory `matlib` exists. This directory primarily exists for me to experiment with various implementations, languages, build systems etc. that is not possible to do as part of the regular course.
